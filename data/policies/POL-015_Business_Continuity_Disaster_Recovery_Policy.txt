- Finance and Accounting Systems: RTO 24 hours, RPO 4 hours
- HR and Payroll Systems: RTO 48 hours, RPO 24 hours

Financial impact assessment documents revenue loss, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage from extended outages.

Multi-Region Deployment:
- Active-active production infrastructure across AWS US-East-1 and US-West-2 regions
- Automatic failover with global load balancing and health monitoring
- Real-time database replication with conflict resolution and data consistency verification
- Customer data replicated across 3 availability zones per region

Backup Strategy:
- Continuous database transaction log backup with 15-minute synchronization
- Hourly incremental application backups with daily full backups
- Backup retention: 30 days online, 90 days nearline, 7 years compliance archive
- Immutable backups protected from ransomware with air-gapped copies
- Cross-region backup replication to geographically distant region

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:

- Disaster recovery plan documented with runbooks for 15 disaster scenarios
- Failover testing conducted quarterly with actual traffic cutover to secondary region
- Annual disaster recovery exercise simulating complete primary region failure with executive participation
- System restoration procedures documented with step-by-step instructions and automation scripts
- Emergency contact roster maintained with 24/7 on-call rotation for critical personnel
- Alternate work arrangements enabling 100% remote work capability demonstrated during pandemic

BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS:

Departmental BC plans cover:

PANDEMIC AND REMOTE WORK:
Remote work capabilities fully implemented with VPN capacity for 100% of workforce, virtual collaboration tools, and dispersed infrastructure eliminating single points of facility failure.

CYBER RECOVERY:
Incident response plan integrates with DR procedures for ransomware, data breach, or cyberattack scenarios. Isolated recovery environment maintained for malware-free restoration.
