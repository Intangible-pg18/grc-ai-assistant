POLICY ID: POL-005
TITLE: Password and Authentication Policy
VERSION: 5.1
LAST UPDATED: 2025-01-14
OWNER: Chief Information Security Officer
REGULATORY MAPPING: SOC 2 CC6.1, ISO 27001 A.9.4.3, NIST 800-63B, PCI DSS 8.2

PURPOSE:
This policy establishes password complexity requirements, authentication standards, and multi-factor authentication controls to protect Diligent systems and data from unauthorized access. Strong authentication is the primary defense against account compromise and credential-based attacks.

SCOPE:
Applies to all user accounts, service accounts, administrative accounts, API keys, and authentication mechanisms across Diligent's corporate network, production systems, SaaS applications, cloud infrastructure, and customer-facing platforms.

PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS:

- Minimum length: 14 characters for standard users, 16 characters for privileged accounts
- Complexity: Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Password expiration: 90 days for standard accounts, 60 days for privileged accounts, 30 days for service accounts
- Password history: Cannot reuse previous 12 passwords
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts trigger 30-minute lockout with security alert
- No common passwords permitted (checked against NIST breach database and common password lists)
- Password storage: bcrypt or Argon2 hashing only, minimum 12 rounds, salted

MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA):

- Mandatory for all employees accessing corporate email, VPN, cloud infrastructure, and production systems
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn) required for administrators and DevOps personnel
- Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) acceptable for standard users via authenticator apps
- SMS-based MFA discouraged due to SIM swapping risks, only permitted for low-risk applications
- Backup codes generated and securely stored for account recovery scenarios
- MFA enrollment required within 24 hours of account provisioning

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:

- Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML 2.0 mandatory for all SaaS applications supporting federation
- Passwordless authentication with biometrics or security keys encouraged for supported applications
- Service account passwords stored in enterprise password vault (HashiCorp Vault) with access logging
- Password sharing strictly prohibited; shared credentials must be eliminated or transitioned to service accounts
- Default/vendor passwords must be changed immediately upon system deployment
- Automated password rotation for API keys and service accounts every 90 days
- Emergency access procedures documented with break-glass accounts protected by multiple approvers

SESSION MANAGEMENT:
- Idle timeout: 15 minutes for standard sessions, 5 minutes for administrative sessions
- Absolute session timeout: 8 hours requiring re-authentication
- Concurrent session limits enforced to prevent credential sharing
