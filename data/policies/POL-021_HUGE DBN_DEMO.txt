PURPOSE:
This policy establishes the organization's procedures for data breach notification in compliance with GDPR Article 33 (notification to supervisory authority) and GDPR Article 34 (communication to data subjects).

   - Name and contact details of the Data Protection Officer (DPO)
   - Description of the likely consequences of the breach
