REGULATION: System and Organization Controls 2 (SOC 2)
REGULATION ID: REG-002
JURISDICTION: United States (Global Standard)
GOVERNING BODY: American Institute of CPAs (AICPA)
FRAMEWORK: Trust Services Principles and Criteria (TSPC)
EFFECTIVE DATE: 2017 Trust Services Criteria (Updated 2020)
APPLICABILITY TO DILIGENT: Service Organization providing SaaS platform

REGULATORY OVERVIEW:
SOC 2 is an auditing standard developed by AICPA for service organizations to demonstrate security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy controls. SOC 2 reports provide assurance to customers that service organizations have appropriate controls to protect customer data and maintain service reliability.

SOC 2 REPORT TYPES:

Type I Report:
Evaluates control design at a specific point in time. Auditor assesses whether controls are suitably designed to meet Trust Services Criteria. Does not test operating effectiveness.

Type II Report:
Evaluates both control design and operating effectiveness over a period (typically 6-12 months). Auditor tests controls to verify they operated effectively throughout the audit period. Preferred by enterprise customers.

TRUST SERVICES CATEGORIES:

1. SECURITY (Mandatory - Common Criteria):
Foundational category required for all SOC 2 audits. Addresses protection of system resources against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, destruction, or modification.

Common Criteria Control Areas:
- CC1: Control Environment (COSO framework, tone at top, organizational structure)
- CC2: Communication and Information (internal/external communication of objectives and responsibilities)
- CC3: Risk Assessment (identification and assessment of risks to achieving objectives)
- CC4: Monitoring Activities (ongoing and separate evaluations of control effectiveness)
- CC5: Control Activities (policies and procedures ensuring management directives executed)
- CC6: Logical and Physical Access Controls (restricting access to authorized users)
- CC7: System Operations (monitoring, incident management, configuration management)
- CC8: Change Management (managing changes to system infrastructure, software, data)
- CC9: Risk Mitigation (managing vendor and business partner risks)

2. AVAILABILITY (Optional - A1 Category):
System available for operation and use as committed or agreed. Addresses business continuity, disaster recovery, and incident response.

Key Control Objectives:
- Infrastructure and software maintained to support availability commitments
- Recovery and business continuity plans established and tested
- Incidents detected, communicated, and resolved timely
- Uptime SLAs monitored and reported (typically 99.9% or higher)

3. PROCESSING INTEGRITY (Optional - PI1 Category):
System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized to meet entity's objectives.

Key Control Objectives:
- Input data complete, accurate, and authorized before processing
- Processing accurate, complete, and timely
- Output processing accurate and complete
- Error handling and correction procedures implemented
- Data quality monitoring and validation controls

4. CONFIDENTIALITY (Optional - C1 Category):
Information designated as confidential protected as committed or agreed. Addresses protection of proprietary, strategic, and sensitive business information.

Key Control Objectives:
- Confidential information identified and classified
- Access to confidential information restricted to authorized users
- Confidential information protected during transmission and storage
- Confidential information disposal procedures secure and complete

5. PRIVACY (Optional - P1-P8 Categories):
Personal information collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed in conformity with commitments in entity's privacy notice.

Privacy Principles:
- P1: Notice to data subjects about privacy practices
- P2: Choice and consent for collection, use, and disclosure
- P3: Collection limited to identified purposes with consent
- P4: Use, retention, and disposal limited to purposes specified
- P5: Access for individuals to review and correct personal information
- P6: Disclosure to third parties only as specified and with consent
- P7: Quality maintained with procedures for accuracy and completeness
- P8: Monitoring and enforcement to ensure compliance with privacy commitments

SOC 2 AUDIT PROCESS:

Readiness Assessment (Optional):
Pre-audit assessment by CPA firm identifying control gaps and recommendations before formal audit. Helps ensure successful audit outcome.

Planning Phase (4-6 Weeks):
- Scope definition: Systems, processes, and trust service categories included
- Control identification: Mapping controls to Trust Services Criteria
- Test plan development: Defining audit procedures and sample sizes
- Kick-off meeting with management and control owners

Fieldwork Phase (8-12 Weeks for Type II):
- Control design evaluation through walkthroughs and documentation review
- Operating effectiveness testing through sampling and evidence examination
- Minimum 60-90 days of operation for Type II audit
- Management responses obtained for deficiencies identified

Reporting Phase (4-6 Weeks):
- Draft report issued to management for review and comment
- Management representation letter obtained
- Final SOC 2 report issued with:
  * Management's description of system
  * Independent service auditor's report
  * Description of Trust Services Criteria
  * Control objectives and related controls
  * Test results and exceptions noted
  * Complementary User Entity Controls (CUECs) if applicable

CONTROL MATURITY LEVELS:

Control testing may identify:
- Effective Controls: Designed and operating effectively, no exceptions noted
- Deficiencies: Control design or operating gaps not rising to significant deficiency
- Significant Deficiencies: Control weaknesses that could adversely affect ability to meet criteria
- Material Weaknesses: Deficiencies or combination of deficiencies that create reasonable possibility criteria not met

COMPLEMENTARY USER ENTITY CONTROLS (CUECs):
Controls that user organizations must implement for system to operate effectively. Examples:
- Users maintain password confidentiality and complexity
- Users review access logs and report suspicious activity
- Users perform user access reviews and remove terminated employees
- Users maintain secure network connections to service

SUBSERVICE ORGANIZATIONS:
When service organization uses subservice providers (e.g., AWS, Azure), two approaches:
1. Carve-Out Method: Exclude subservice provider from scope, rely on their SOC 2 report
2. Inclusive Method: Include subservice provider controls in scope, auditor tests controls
